# Chatloja frontend

### Running the application

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables, there is a `.env.example` file that you can use as a template.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000 # The URL of the backend
ADMIN_TOKEN=77d60dae-ce02-463f-9bf9-daf307a0af17 # The token of the admin user
```

3. Run the application. Maybe is a good idea to run the backend first.

```bash
npm run dev
```
